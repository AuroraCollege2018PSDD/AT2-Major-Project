# AT2-Major-Project
Major Project is to develop a Graphical Hangman Game using pygame

##Overview
You will be working in groups of two to three students to create a simple game for a client.
 
We will use a modified version of the agile approach with the process broken down into manageable tasks.
 
There will be client consultation meetings on Tue Week 3 and Thu Week 5. These will set the criteria for 3 sprints finishing Tue Week 5; Tue Week 8 and Thu Week 10. At the end of each sprint you need to convene a meeting with the client. It will be your responsibility to 'book' this but unless there are exceptional circumstances these should be in each Thursday class.
 
The project must be handed in by end of the school day (4 pm) on Thu Week 10 or as those of you familiar with ISO 8610 (an I hope that's all of you) then the hand in time is 2018-07-05T 06:00:00+10:00.
